# Introduction

Technical Note TN-001 introduced a new approach to seamless bleed generation by preserving continuous visual appearance beyond the trim edge.

Further development of the same geometric foundation has resulted in an additional capability that significantly extends the flexibility of professional bleed generation.

BleedMaster is no longer limited to applying identical bleed behaviour on all four page sides.

---

## The Long-Standing Limitation

Traditional bleed generation applies identical processing around the complete page.

Even when different bleed widths are supported, the underlying image transformation generally remains uniform. Independent behaviour for each individual page side introduces additional geometric complexity, particularly within the corner regions where two independently processed bleed strips meet.

Maintaining visually seamless corner continuity under these conditions has remained an unresolved challenge.

---

## A New Result

BleedMaster introduces a fundamentally different approach.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly documented solution capable of producing:

- independently configurable **top** bleed,
- independently configurable **bottom** bleed,
- independently configurable **left** bleed,
- independently configurable **right** bleed,
- visually seamless corner continuity,
- consistent results using independent **scaling**,
- consistent results using independent **stretching**, and
- consistent results using independent **mirroring**.

Each page side can operate completely independently while preserving a continuous visual appearance throughout the complete bleed construction.

---

## Validation

The method has been successfully validated using independently configurable parameters for all four page sides.

### Validated Configuration Range

- independent **Top** configuration
- independent **Bottom** configuration
- independent **Left** configuration
- independent **Right** configuration

All tested combinations maintained continuous visual corner transitions without introducing visible discontinuities.

The underlying concept is scalable beyond these validated configurations.

## Technical Disclosure

This Technical Note documents the existence of the achieved result.

The underlying geometry, mathematical principles and implementation remain intentionally undisclosed. Only the achieved capabilities and validated results are presented in this publication.

---

## Conclusion

BleedMaster extends seamless bleed generation beyond uniform page-wide processing.

Independent bleed behaviour can now be applied to every individual page side while preserving seamless visual continuity throughout the complete bleed construction.

This Technical Note documents an additional capability of the BleedMaster geometric engine while intentionally withholding the underlying implementation for future technical publications.
